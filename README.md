# EndogenousLVModeration
Please email [Michael Frisby](mailto:mbfrisby@umich.edu?subject=[GitHub]%20Endogenous%20Latent%20Moderation) at [mbfrisby@umich.edu](mailto:mbfrisby@umich.edu?subject=[GitHub]%20Endogenous%20Latent%20Moderation) for questions concerning the use of the following code.

## Description 
This repository contains the R code needed to calculate the variance of endogenous latent variables. 

To use this code, you will need to install R (https://www.r-project.org/). Next, open EndoModeratorVarCalculator.R in R. The commented code will walk you through constructing and multiplying the necessary matrices.

MarchandOutput.txt contains the relevant Mplus output for constructing the matrices found in the code. Use this as a reference to determine where these numbers come from, and to guide you in building matrices for *your* output.
